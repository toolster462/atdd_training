# ATDD Blog Project

```
As a blogger
I want to share my thoughts with the world
so that everyone knows how brilliant I am
    - blog post consists of title, author and post content
    - all fields are required
    - should not be able to create 2 posts with the same title
```
```
As a reader
I want to see the 10 most recent posts from my favorite blogger
so that  I can keep up with their brilliance
    - posts should be ordered with the newest at the top
    - only want the previous 10
    - want to see the title, a little of the post body, the name of the author, and the post date
```
```
As a reader
I want to read a full post
so that I have all of the details and can impress my neighbors
    - accessible from the list of posts
    - should be able to read the whole post body
```
```
As a reader
I want to leave comments on a blog post
so that everyone can see that I am as brilliant as the blogger
    - should be able to leave many comments
    - comment is some text, and name of the person leaving the comment
    - should be able to see all comments, ordered with the oldest comment at the top
